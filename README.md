### \[[Project Website](https://webfetch.pages.dev/)\]

Webfetch is a browser information tool written in `JavaScript`. Webfetch is used to display information about your browser and it's host system, such as the browser, engine, OS etc.

The main purpose of Webfetch is to act as visual eye-candy to display in screenshots of your system. It's not meant to be a full replacement for command line information tools such as Neofetch or proper system diagnosis tools.

By default, Webfetch displays an ASCII logo of the browser you are currently using along with the info. The logo displayed can be changed by the user via the use of simple commands.

Webfetch is currently in the pre-release stage, so bugs can be expected. If you find any bugs please report them by opening up an issue.
